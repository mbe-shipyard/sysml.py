# This YAML file contains a SysML model sample template of the hypothetical FireSat mission.

# The intent of this template is to provide a lightweight human-readable data
# serialization format for describing a SysML model.
# The SysML model consists of model elements and relationshipts, wherein model elements
# are treated as a list of nodes and model relations are treated as a list of edges.

# YAML can be validated using https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator
# (WIP): A schema will be used to validate whether a YAML file is also a valid SysML model
# (WIP): a complementary python api will be provided for generating the 9 SysML diagrams from this template.

# Notes: labels and id_no's must be unique per stereotype

Description: A SysML model sample template for the hypothetical FireSat mission

elements: # model elements are treated as a dictionary of nodes
# An alternative design paradigm may be to nest key-value pairs such that labels
# are sorted under their respective stereotype. Note: such an approach means the
# stereotype context is lost when defining relationships between model elements
    package-1: #  FireSat mission requirements are contained within a package
        label: FireSat Mission requirements
    package-2: # functional requirements define how well the system must perform to meet its objectives
        label: Functional requirements
    requirement-1: # Functional requirement of the FireSat mission
        label: Performance
        text: temperature, resolution, and location accuracy

        label: Temperature Performance
        text: 4 temperature levels
    requirement-3: # Functional requirement of the FireSat mission

    requirement-4:
        label: Secondary Mission
        text: 4 temperature levels for pest management # In FireSat example, this would include additional measurement channels for forest management data (e.g. pest control)
    package-2:
        label: Operational
    requirement-4:
        label: Duration
        text: Mission operational fat least 10 years # factors impacting this requirement include nature of the mission (experimental or operational), level of redundancy, orbit (e.g., altitude)
    requirement-5:
        label: Availability
        text: 98% excluding weather # Impacting factors include level of redundancy
    requirement-6:
        label: Availability
        text: 3-day maximum outage # Impacting factors include level of redundancy
    requirement-7:
        label: Data distribution
        text: Up to 500 fire-monitoring offices # Impacting factors include communications architecture
    requirement-8:
        label: Data distribution
        text: +2000 rangers worldwide (max. of 100 simultaneous users) # Impacting factors include communications architecture
    requirement-9:
        label: Data content form format # Impacting factors include user needs, level and place of processing, payload
        text: Location and extent of fire on any of 12 map bases, average tempurature for each 30 m^2 grid
    requirement-10:
        label: Mission constraint-s
    constraint-1:
        label: Cost # Impacting factors include manned flight, numbers of spacecraft size and complexity, orbit
        text: < $20M/yr + R&D
    constraint-2:
        label: Schedule 1 # Impacting factors include technical readiness, programme size
        text: Initial operating capability within 5 yrs
    constraint-3:
        label: Schedule 2 # Impacting factors include technical readiness, programme size
        text: Final operating capability within 6 years
    constraint-4:
        label: Regulations # Impacting factors include law and policy
        text: NASA mission

        text: No unique operations people at data distribution nodes

relationships: # model relationships are treated as a list edges
# note that the anchors created in `elements` are being used to reference list items treated as source and target nodes
